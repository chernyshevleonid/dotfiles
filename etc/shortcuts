### Certain Shortcuts Hither and Thither.
##
# TODO: Make this more dynamic.
#       Let's have functions to push and pop places and on-arrival actions to or from the list.
#       So keep a list of places and actions in a file and loop through it.
#       tag: [place, actions: [action, auto-invoke?]]
# TODO: Make this more versatile.
#       Restore more context for a project, e.g. redefine some aliases, e.g. alias psql='psql $database_for_project'
# TODO: Make this machine agnostic.
#       Have the map in a separate file named after the hostname.
