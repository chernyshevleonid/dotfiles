  DOTFILES

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Currently:

  etc/bashrc  -- An eclectic bash profile.
    Current state: Works For Me™, a.k.a. Βητα, a.k.a. Beta-eta-tau-alpha.
    See the comments.
    Features: 
    * Distinguishes Darwin (BSD) and Linux.
 	* History per directory (default) or per terminal,
      plus a global command archive.
    * Directory stack aliased to cd / pd.
    * Directory change hook (in prompt_callback), 
	  e.g. to display a TODO or README file.
	* "Session Restore" on startup: current per-tty directory is saved
	  and cd'd into upon startup.
	* Common aliases: shortcuts considered useful.
	* Common path setup: the usual */bin places 
	  plus ./script (for Rails and the like).
	* Git branch display in prompt.
	* Can exec a command instead of dropping user to the prompt:
	  Set EXEC_IMMEDIATELY to command before invoking bash.
	* Uses colour for ls, grep, less, man, and the prompt.
	* Certainly abuses 'certainly'. But see the comments.

  etc/psqlrc  -- An eclectic psql (PostgreSQL interactive client) profile.
 	It has neither known bugs nor comments.
    Features: 
	* Prompt showing user and database.
	* Per-Database History.
	* Always uses PAGER -- works well with less set to exit-if-single-page.

  etc/gitconfig  -- A basic git default config.
 	Needs editing to be useful: just insert your name and email address.
	* Defines some common aliases.
	* Enables colour.

Installation:
    0. Install git (package git-core in Debian/Ubuntu and BSD ports)
	1. git clone git://github.com/scivi/dotfiles.git
	2. sh install.sh
	   It creates symlinks in your $HOME, so you can benefit 
	   from future updates, easily merge your own changes etc, courtesy of git.
	   It keeps copies of existing files, date/time appended to their name.
	3. edit .gitconfig: change name and email.
	4. source ~/.bashrc
	
Updates:
	0. cd $dotfiles-directory  # whereever you put it.
